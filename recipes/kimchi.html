            <h4>"Kimchi, an iconic Korean dish, is a delicious and spicy variety of pickle that is resplendent with a perfect balance of bold and lively flavors. This fermented dish is composed primarily of Napa cabbage and radishes, marinated in a blend of seasonings including garlic, ginger, chili paste and other aromatics. The result is an explosion of flavors, from the crisp freshness of the vegetables to the spiciness and umami depth of the fermented seasonings."</h4>
