        <h3>Steps to make Lasagna</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the lasagna sheets according to the package instructions. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground meat over medium heat until browned. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and cook until tender.</li>
            <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 20-30 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, mix the ricotta cheese with the egg and Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
            <li>In a baking dish, layer with a thin spread of the meat mixture, followed by a layer of lasagna sheets, and then a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture. Repeat until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes or until the lasagna is bubbly and golden on top.</li>
            <li>Allow the lasagna to rest for about 10 minutes before cutting.</li>
            <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
